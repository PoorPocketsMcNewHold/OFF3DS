# OFF3DS
A 3DS port of **OFF,** the cult classic 2008 surrealist RPG by Mortis Ghost. Built via [Easy3DS.](https://github.com/msikma/Easy3DS)

**This is based on the [v2.0 English translation by RecDra!](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Fan/Games/OFF-by-Mortis-Ghost/page/3#post1907821)**

I own nothing - this is strictly an unofficial fan project to help spread the word about this amazing game!
